# JSON to RAML Datatype - Converter

## Overview
RAML is a language for the definition of HTTP-based APIs that embody most or all of the principles of REST. In Mulesoft while designing an API using API Designer developer should provide Request and Response Examples along with Datatype in RAML format.

As a developer, we usually receive JSON examples and need to convert them to RAML Datatype on our own. 

- if JSON Example is just 10 lines - Easy Peasy ðŸ˜Ž
- if JSON Example exceeds 1400 lines - well that's gonna be hard ðŸ˜ª

I've faced this kind of issue in one of my projects. where we need to create a Datatype for an example that has over 1800 lines. Well, it took us nearly 4 hours to create a basic #datatype.

So I questioned why we should spend so much time in Copy & Pasting in 2022. I came up with a pretty # straightforward #solution.
